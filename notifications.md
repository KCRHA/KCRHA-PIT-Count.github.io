#### Managing Printer Issues

We are currently working to solve our barcode printer issues so that every site is able to print from any device.

Until we have a full solution, please check with your Hub Lead for guidance, and if needed, _clearly_ fill in the referral barcode numbers using a pen or permanent marker.

It is essential that the alphanumeric codes are _clear_ and _legible_. 

Thanks for all you are doing!
